Compilation Instructions:
-----------------------

Just run "make" to create the timebuffer.ko and the producer/consumer programs.

Running Instructions:
-----------------------

1. Make sure that the device is unloaded or the device with same name doesn't
   exist. Type "sudo ./buffer_unload".

2. Load the timedbuffer module  using command "sudo ./buffer_load". This will create
   a device called /dev/timedbuffer.

3. The commands to run testcases are present in a file called testcase.sh. 
   This script takes the test case number as the parameter. 
   To execute a testcase type "./testcase.sh <testcasenumber>".

Output Logfile Names:
----------------

1. The producers each write the item they have produced into their respective
   log files. 

2. The name of the logfile of a producer has the following format: Prod_<second-arg>.log 
   where the <second-arg> is the parameter passed to the producer which is the name of
   item that a particular producer will produce. For example: 
            producer 50 red
  producer writes its output in logfile Prod_red.log.

3. The consumers each write the item they have consumed into their respective log files.
   The name of the logfile of a consumer has the following format: Cons_<second-arg>.log
   where <second-arg> is the parameter passed to the consumer program which is
   an id entifier for a consumer. This argument must be unique per consumer.

Test Case Description:
-----------------------

1. 	Testcase #1: 
	-------------
	In  this testcase the producer deposits 50 items into /dev/timebuffer.
        These 50 items are remove by the consumer.
   
   	Expected Output: 
	----------------
	The producer and consumer both must exit normally and the consumer must
	get all the 50 items.
   
	Running instructions: 
	----------------------
	Type "./testcase.sh 1" to execute this test case. The producer output
	can be seen in file Prod_case1_red.log and the consumer output can be
	seen in the file Cons_case1.log.

2. 	Testcase #2: 
	-------------
	This test case consists of a one producer and one consumer. The producer
	will try to deposit 50 items into /dev/timedbuffer. 
        The consumer will remove only 10 items and then  exit. 
   
	Expected Output: 
	-----------------
        The consumer will read 10 items and exit.
	For the given buffer size  of 20  for the timedbuffer, the producer can deposit
	up to 30 more  items into the timedbuffer and exit after a timeout of 20 seconds,  
        once the consumer exits. 
   
	Running Instructions:
	----------------------
	Type "./testcase.sh 2" to execute this test case. The producer output
	can be seen in file Prod_case2_red.log and the consumer output can be
	seen in the file Cons_case2.log.

3.	Testcase #3:
	-------------
	This test case consists of one producer and one consumer. 
        The producer deposits only 50 items into /dev/timedbuffer before exiting.
        The consumer wants to remove 100 items, but it will be able to get 
        only 50 items.

	Expected Output:
	-----------------
	The producer will write 50 items into /dev/timedbuffer.
	The consumer will remove 50 items and then after 20 seconds timeout
        period it will exit since there are no producers.

	Running Instructions:
	----------------------
	Type "./testcase.sh 3" to execute this test case. The producer output
	can be seen in file Prod_case3_red.log and the consumer output can be
	seen in the file Cons_case3.log.
